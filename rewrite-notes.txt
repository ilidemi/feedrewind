## Static analysis wishlist


## Ruby -> Go patterns
ensure -> defer func(){}()
to_s -> String() (with receiver being a copy, not a pointer)
Links.each_with_index -> {{range $i, $ := .Links}}

## View helpers
<%= link_to "Link", "/path" -> <a href="/path">Link</a>
<%= form_with url: "subscriptions/add" -> <form action="subscriptions/add" accept-charset="UTF-8"
<%= form.url_field -> just <input type="url", id if needed
<%= hidden_field_tag "key", value1 %> -> <input type="hidden" name="key" id="key" value="value1">


## Small dynamic mangles that needed to be consolidated


## Modeling sum return types as interfaces postmortem


## What helped
Tests tests tests, my and Ruby and E2E
Log of execution in form of progress status reported to the user. Just lots of tiny errors


## Fuckups
User and session management doesn't use transactions and that'll probably bite me in the ass at some point

### Ruby date parse porting
Minor oversights like missing month name -> month number conversion when they're both strings
Pointer arithmetic on strings is ass, doesn't map well to Go's slicing
Understanding custom string comparison things in Ruby
Could I do it without tests? 80% but fishing out the remaining 20 would be hell. there's a reason the original code has tests
Actually the learning could be don't port code that doesn't have a ton of data driven tests
Typos typos, especially in the similar looking fields I don't care about


## Not great
Date parsing is forgiving in Ruby, strict in Go.
html/template takes 80-100ms on SSC posts list
Map randomization generated work and removed convenience. Had to pull in a sorted map package
Matching sorted links except a highlighted one seems fishy, but let's have it break
Taking pointers to loop variables bitten me multiple times.
