## Static analysis wishlist


## Ruby -> Go patterns
ensure -> defer func(){}()
to_s -> String()

Returning errors as errors loses stacktrace. Panicking scatters Must* everywhere. Some funcs eventually need to panic on db but return err on duplicate user and midway solution is required there. Currently sticking with nested error messages.

## View helpers
<%= link_to "Link", "/path" -> <a href="/path">Link</a>
<%= form_with url: "subscriptions/add" -> <form action="subscriptions/add" accept-charset="UTF-8"
<%= form.url_field -> just <input type="url", id if needed


## Small dynamic mangles that needed to be consolidated


## Modeling sum return types as interfaces postmortem


## Fuckups
User and session management doesn't use transactions and that'll probably bite me in the ass at some point
